# Numerical-Methods
## Masters in Astrophysics and Space Science - Rome Semester 1

'Numerical Methods'  is a module in the first term of the MSc in Astrophysics and Space Science (MASS) program. This course covers a practical introduction to computational techniques in Python, essential for solving complex problems encountered in astrophysics. The idea of the lectures in this module is to ensure all students have a suffient proficiency of Python, to serve for the rest of the masters program.
